# **App Name**: ChainGuardian

## Core Features:

- Reown Wallet Connection: Enable users to connect their wallets using Reown, supporting social login (Google, etc.) and smart wallet creation for new users. Wallet will be pre-configured to use Base L2 (Ethereum).
- Realm Exploration: Allow players to explore a 2D/isometric realm (Scam Swamp) with interactive points of interest, educational encounters (phishing monsters, fake treasure), and quest objectives.
- Inventory Display: Show a grid view of owned NFT items with details (stats, rarity), allow equipping items to avatar. Only ERC1155 items on the Base blockchain can be shown. Support for trade/crafting will be added in a future version.
- Crew System: Enable users to create or join crews (guilds) with shared treasury and crew chat (real-time).
- Security Quizzes: Periodically show progressive security quizzes that educate and test user knowledge to maintain the in-game Trust Score, a game metric which reflects real-world responsible behavior regarding cryptocurrency. Only logged-in, connected users can take security quizzes.
- AI-Powered Scam Detection Tool: The Guardian system uses AI to perform real-time transaction analysis, looking for patterns of known scams, interacting with a registry of blacklisted parties and contracts to determine if any of the involved addresses are on the blacklist, using a tool.
- Voxel editor: Allow players to customize builds in their hideout space

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Base Blue (#0052FF) for a futuristic cyberpunk feel, reflecting the Base L2 blockchain.
- Background color: Deep dark blue-black (#0A0E27) to enhance the cyberpunk atmosphere with a dark mode interface.
- Accent color: Neon cyan (#00D4FF), analogous to Base Blue but brighter, used for highlighting interactive elements and glows.
- Headers: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif font, to convey a techy, scientific aesthetic.
- Body: 'Inter' sans-serif font, for a clean, modern, neutral feel that suits both headlines and body text. 
- Accent: 'Source Code Pro' monospaced font for code snippets, for maximum legibility. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use neon-glowing icons with a blocky, voxel-style aesthetic to align with the cyberpunk-Minecraft theme.
- Implement glassmorphism for cards and panels to give the UI a modern, elevated appearance. Ensure elements are well-spaced and easy to interact with.
- Incorporate subtle animations and particle effects, especially on hover, to create a dynamic user experience. Use animated scanlines for a cyberpunk touch.
